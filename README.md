# Makeschool-Summer-2016-Examples

These examples were created during the Makeschool 2016 Summer Program. These examples mostly cover SpriteKit, and 
were created in response to discussions with students. 

### Bezier Landscape - Illustrates a system for creating an endless physics landscape drawn from curves. This tries to give 
some insight as to how games like Tiny Wings and Alto's Adventure function.
